# Abstract
This App is made for my University hostel room counselling.In my University, rooms are allocated in the order of academic rankings and students with better ranks get to choose their room preferences(cheaper(the main purpose of the app) or larger rooms get filled faster) and roommates.So the problem i felt in the system was that ,as every year this hostel room counseling takes place, students have to change their roommates either because they don't like their current roommates or  the person who took them in his room last year lost his rank this time and himself has to find a roomtaker thereby leaving his remaining roommates without a room too, who again have to find roomtakers.So it becomes difficult to approach unknown roomtakers(academic rankers) individually physically asking each person who would match their roomtype preferences.

# App Description
This App provides a platform for roomtakers to add a room if they believe that will get that particular roomtype for their rank and the people searching for rooms can browse through the room vacancies in the rooms added by roomtakers.firebase realtime database has been used to store and retreive data and firebase authentication is used to authenticate users.
